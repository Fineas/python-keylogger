# python-keylogger
A small python script for logging all pressed keys

## How To Use

- REQUIREMENTS

  The program is pretty simple, but before evrything, you need to download a python module called `pyHook`

- USSAGE
  
  1. For a basic ussage, you can either go to `cmd` and type: `python \path_to_file\keylogger.pyw` either double click and choose to open with `python`
  2. For a more hackish ussage, use the `.bat` file as well. First go and find out the exact location of the program you want to open simultaniously with the python script.

  Next go and edit the `.bat` file and place your path.

  Now, make the `.bat` file look like the program you also want to open and...enjoy keylogging.
  
- STOP
  
  For stopping the program from running press: `CTRL+ALT+DEL` and choose `Task Manager`, there search for your process (the pythonw process) and kill it.
